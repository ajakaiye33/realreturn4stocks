This application serves as an advanced tool for investors aiming to optimize their stock trading strategies. It performs a sophisticated financial analysis to calculate the ideal minimum and maximum selling prices per share for a stock, ensuring a real, inflation-adjusted profit. 

The app takes into account multiple factors including the stock's initial purchase price, the date of purchase, your targeted rate of return, the current rate of inflation (CPI), the total number of shares you've purchased, and any additional fees or charges you've incurred during the transaction. 

The algorithm behind the calculations assumes a minimum holding period of 6 months for the stock, but can also accommodate longer or shorter holding periods as specified by the user.
